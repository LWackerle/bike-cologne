# bike-cologne bike:
Small group project for [CorrelAid](https://correlaid.org/)s local chapter Cologne using bike data in the city.

To get started have a look at `download_data` and `analysis`.

We meet every second Monday remotely via the [CorrelAid-Slack](https://correlaid.org/en/volunteer/) - come join us!
